# Practical DevOps - Kubernetes, Docker, Linux 

Essential concepts and commands for devops.
- useful in practice and preparation for certification like [CKAD](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/).

There is a lot of stuff to remember when working with kubernetes, containers (docker, podman etc) and the linux command line in a devops context.

 I compiled the material in this repo to help me revise and as a reference. It may help you too.
